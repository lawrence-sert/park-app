Introduction:
Welcome to Park and Pick mobile application. We are here to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers. 
This platform will allow you to get the freshest farm produce straight from the farm. We aim to improve
how our users consume their food by providing daily tips and nutritious recipes. 

Be A Farmer:
The application allows you to join as a farmer. Where you will be able to get daily statistics on the demand 
of your produce. This will help in planing what exactly to farm in relation to what the market is demanding.

Be A Vendor:
You can be a registered local vendor and earn extra money, through getting consumer orders and supplying. 
Vendors will earn a commission from all their completed sales. This initiative is to also help create passive
income for lady vendors.

Happy Family:
It is our goal to make sure we put a plate of nutritious food on every home table in Rwanda. Will archive this by 
making sure that our farmers get the right information on what the market requires and can consume. Sharing information 
on alternative recipes that families can try.
